🚨 Crime Anomaly Detection Using Deep Learning & Surveillance Cameras
Crime detection through AI-powered surveillance is a game-changer for public safety. Our project leverages deep learning and computer vision to analyze surveillance footage by converting crime-related videos into images and detecting anomalies that indicate suspicious activity.

By using MobileNet as a feature extractor and TensorFlow & OpenCV for image processing, our system enables real-time crime detection and can be integrated into CCTV networks, smart cities, and law enforcement tools.

📌 Key Features
✅ Video-to-Image Conversion: Extracts frames from surveillance videos for deep learning analysis.
✅ AI-Powered Crime Detection: Identifies anomalies in crime-related images using MobileNet.
✅ Surveillance Integration: Optimized for CCTV cameras and real-time crime monitoring.
✅ Preprocessing & Augmentation: Enhances accuracy with data cleaning and augmentation techniques.
✅ Performance Evaluation: Uses ROC curves, AUC scores, and classification metrics for assessment.
