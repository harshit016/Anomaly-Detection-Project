Anomaly Detection Project

Anomaly detection is a critical task in various industries, from fraud detection in finance to defect identification in manufacturing and disease diagnosis in medical imaging. This project explores an AI-driven approach to detecting anomalies using deep learning techniques and computer vision.

We employ MobileNet, a lightweight and efficient deep learning model, as a feature extractor and leverage TensorFlow & Keras to build and fine-tune the anomaly detection model. The project includes data preprocessing, augmentation techniques, model training, and evaluation using various performance metrics such as ROC curves and AUC scores.

📌 Key Features
✅ Deep Learning-Based Anomaly Detection: Leverages MobileNet and TensorFlow to detect anomalies in datasets.
✅ Preprocessing & Augmentation: Data is preprocessed and augmented to improve model generalization and accuracy.
✅ Advanced Visualization: Uses Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to generate insightful visualizations.
✅ Performance Evaluation: Evaluates models using ROC curves, AUC scores, and classification metrics.
✅ Real-World Applications: Can be adapted for fraud detection, medical diagnostics, and industrial defect detection.
